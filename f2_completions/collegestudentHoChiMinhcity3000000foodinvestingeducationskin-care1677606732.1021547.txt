Food:

Investing: 
Allocate 800,000 VND for investing. Investing is a great way to maximize your income over the long term, and this amount should be enough to open a brokerage account or purchase some stocks or mutual funds. Make sure to do your research before investing and consider setting aside a portion for emergency funds.

Education: 
Allocate 600,000 VND for learning programming. This should cover most of the books, online courses, and other materials you need to learn the subject. You can also look for free online resources to help you learn and save a bit of money.

Skin-care: 
Allocate 200,000 VND for skin-care. This amount should cover basic skin-care products such as lotions, cleansers, and moisturizers. Consider buying products in bulk to save money, or look for deals and coupons. You can also find cheaper alternatives to more expensive products.
