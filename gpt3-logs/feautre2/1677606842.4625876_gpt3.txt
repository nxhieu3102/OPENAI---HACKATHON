I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: shopping, house renting, skin-care, education, food
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: not far from city center
education: ielts learning
food: vegetarian
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: Allocate 1,600,000 VND for house renting. This should cover the cost of renting a house close to the city center.  Consider looking for shared apartments or rooms to reduce costs.

Education: Allocate 500,000 VND for IELTS learning. Consider taking online courses or self-studying materials to reduce costs.

Food: Allocate 500,000 VND for food. Consider shopping at local markets, stocking up on food items that can be used multiple times, and planning meals in advance to reduce costs.

Shopping: Allocate 500,000 VND for shopping. Consider buying items on sale and avoiding impulse purchases to reduce costs. 

Skin-care: Allocate 400,000 VND for skincare. Consider using natural products and looking for discounts to reduce costs.
