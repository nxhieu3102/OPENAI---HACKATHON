I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: education, shopping, commuting, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
education: ielts learning
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability
