I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: commuting, house renting, playing sport, food
Specific constraints for each demand: 
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
house renting: not far from city center

Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Commuting: Motorbike (10 km) – Allocate 4000000 VND for purchase and maintenance of a motorbike. This will provide you with the most efficient mode of transportation for your daily commute. 

House Renting: Rent a house or room close to the city center – Allocate 5000000 VND per month for rent. This will allow you to remain close to the city center and enjoy the convenience of living close to your school. 

Playing Sport: Allocate 500000 VND for a karate class. This will give you access to the sport and help you stay active. 

Food: Allocate 500000 VND for high protein food. This will give you the fuel necessary to stay healthy and energized. 

Total: 15000000 VND
