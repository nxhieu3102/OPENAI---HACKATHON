1) 1 bottle of La Crema, Chardonnay (750ml) at a price of VND 200,000. This white wine has ripe fruit and crisp acidity that complements the richness of grilled salmon.

2) 1 bottle of Jermann Vintage Tunina (750ml) at a price of VND 1,400,00. This white wine has a complex flavor profile of citrus, honey and saltiness that goes really well with the smoky notes of grilled salmon.

3) 1 bottle of Grover Riesling (750ml) at a price of VND 190,000. This white wine has subtle sweetness and acidic profile that works beautifully when paired with grilled salmon.

TOTAL COST: VND 1,790,000  (less than your budget)

These are my recommendations which should provide you with an optimal combination for your budget, with all three wines pairing beautifully with grilled salmon. Enjoy your meal!
