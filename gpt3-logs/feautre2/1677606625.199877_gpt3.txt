I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, house renting, investing, shopping, entertaining
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: gyming, dancing
house renting: not far from city center
entertaining: party, go to coffee
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sport:
Allocate 25% of the budget for playing sport. This could be used for gym subscriptions, dance classes or other sports-related activities. Since you are living in Ha Noi, look for gym and dance classes that offer discounts in your area. Prioritize gym subscriptions over dance classes, as gyms are a more cost effective way to stay active. 

House Renting:
Allocate 40% of the budget for house renting. Depending on your budget, you can look for a one-bedroom apartment or a shared accommodation. Prioritize renting closer to the city center, as this will provide you with more value for your money. Consider signing a lease with a landlord, as this will give you more control over your rental terms.

Investing:
Allocate 20% of the budget for investing. Investing in stocks and shares can offer potential returns, but it is important to research the market before you make any decisions. Prioritize risk-free investments over riskier ones, as this will help you to stay within your budget constraints.

Shopping:
Allocate 10% of the budget for shopping. Prioritize essential items over non-essential items, as this will help you to stay within your budget. Consider looking for discounts and coupons to maximize your budget. 

Entertaining:
Allocate 5% of the budget for entertaining. Look for activities that offer discounted rates for college students. Party and go to coffee are great ways to entertain yourself, but consider other activities like going to the movies or attending concerts to get the most out of your budget.
