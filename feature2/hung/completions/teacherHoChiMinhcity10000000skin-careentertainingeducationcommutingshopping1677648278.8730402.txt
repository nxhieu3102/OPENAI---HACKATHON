Skin-care:
For skin-care, I recommend allocating a maximum of 5% of my budget, or 500,000 VND. To maximize my budget, I suggest shopping for products online or in local stores, where prices may be lower than in malls. I should also look for products with natural ingredients, as these are often more affordable and better for my skin in the long-run.

Entertaining:
For entertaining, I recommend allocating a maximum of 20% of my budget, or 2,000,000 VND. To maximize this budget, I suggest looking up discounts for theater and concert tickets online or in local newspapers. I should also consider attending free performances or events in my local area.

Education:
For education, I recommend allocating a maximum of 30% of my budget, or 3,000,000 VND. To maximize this budget, I suggest searching for online courses or language schools in my area that offer discounts or promotional deals. I should also research any free classes or clubs in my area that could help me improve my language skills.

Commuting:
For commuting, I recommend allocating a maximum of 15% of my budget, or 1,500,000 VND. To maximize this budget, I suggest looking into public transportation options such as buses, trains, and shared rides. I should also consider investing in a bicycle or a scooter to help reduce my transportation costs over the long-term.

Shopping:
For shopping, I recommend allocating a maximum of 30% of my budget, or 3,000,000 VND. To maximize this budget, I suggest shopping for items online or in local stores and markets, where prices may be lower than in malls. I should also consider buying items in bulk or on sale, as this can help reduce my overall costs.
