ANSWER: 

==========

1) Fresh produce - This option is the most cost effective and is ideal for those looking to stay within a low-carb diet. With your budget of 3000000 VND, you can buy a good variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, such as apples, oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, as well as some root vegetables such as onions, potatoes and carrots. Not only can you find a variety of different produce within this budget, but it’s also relatively healthy and low in carbohydrates. 

2) Protein sources - For your low-carb diet, you can opt for sources of protein like chicken and fish, two of Vietnam’s most favorite sources of protein, which would fit into your budget. Grilled or baked chicken, for example, is easy to cook and would make for a fulfilling meal. You can also go for fish varieties like trout and salmon, which are both rich in omega-3 fatty acids and relatively low in carbohydrates. 

3) Nuts and seeds - Nuts are high in protein and healthy fats and also contain a considerable amount of carbohydrates, but they’re a good option for those looking to keep their budget to a minimum. Nuts like almonds, walnuts, and cashews are all tasty and nutritious additions to your low-carb diet and you can buy them in bulk for a budget-friendly price. You can also opt to buy bags of seeds like pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower, all of which are a great source of healthy fats, vitamins and minerals. 

Total cost: Your total cost should be less than 3000000 VND.
