==========

The Toyota Vios is an affordable and reliable option that optimizes your budget and meets your requirements. It not only provides you with necessary safety features, but also comes with advanced features at an affordable price. The Toyota Vios comes with 6 airbags, Electronic Stability Control, Hill-start assist control, Adaptive Cruise Control, and more. The current market price for a Toyota Vios is around 579,000,000 VND. 

Another great option is the Toyota Corolla Altis. It has a great safety feature that includes 7 airbags, Anti-lock Braking System, Electronic Stability Control, and Tire Pressure Monitoring. The Corolla Altis also has a modern design, LED projector headlamps, automatic climate control, push start button, and a rearview camera. The current market price for a Toyota Corolla Altis is around 630,000,000 VND. 

Both the Toyota Vios and the Corolla Altis provide plenty of safety features and modern features at an affordable price. They both are within your budget, but the Toyota Vios is a more cost-efficient option since it falls under your budget. The Toyota Corolla Altis, though more expensive, would provide you with more features than the Toyota Vios.
