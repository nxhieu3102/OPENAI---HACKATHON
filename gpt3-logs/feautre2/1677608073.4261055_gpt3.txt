I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, commuting, investing, food, shopping
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: swimming and bicycling
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
food: can not cook
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing sport: 

Swimming: Allocating 3,000,000 VND for an annual membership at a local pool. This will provide access to the pool for a year and will also provide lifeguards and other safety measures that could help to keep you safe while swimming. 

Bicycling: Allocating 2,500,000 VND for a durable, good-quality bicycle. This should last for a while and will provide you with a convenient, affordable, and eco-friendly form of transportation. 

Commuting: Allocating 3,500,000 VND for a reliable motorbike. This will provide you with a quick and easy way to get to school and back, and will also be more cost-effective than taking a bus or taxi. 

Food: Allocating 2,500,000 VND for food. This can be used to purchase healthy, pre-prepared meals for convenience, or purchase food items for you to cook at home. 

Shopping: Allocating 500,000 VND for shopping. This should be used to purchase essential items, such as clothing and toiletries. 

Investing: Allocating 500,000 VND for investing. This can be used to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments to help you build long-term financial security. 

By following this optimized spending plan, you should be able to meet all of your demands while staying within your budget constraints. Additionally, this plan prioritizes essential expenses over non-essential expenses and should help you to build long-term financial stability.
