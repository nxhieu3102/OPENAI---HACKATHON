1. Lace U Neckline Capped Sleeves Mermaid Maxi Dress (VND 455,000): This mermaid-cut maxi dress is made from a delicate lace-like material for a stunning look that won't be too over-the-top. The U-neckline and capped sleeves creates an elegant silhouette fit for a wedding. 

2. A-Line Cold Shoulder Sequins Maxi Gown (VND 615,000): This cold shoulder maxi gown has a subtly v-shaped neckline, sparkling sequin detailing, and a high-low hem line that would be perfect for a wedding. The A-line cut is flattering and sophisticated. 

3. Sheath Long Sleeve Applique Lace Maxi Dress (VND 360,000): With its unique lace applique and scalloped neckline, this maxi dress is the perfect balance of sophisticated elegance and style. The sheer sleeves and back add a subtle hint of detail that is fitting for a wedding. 

The total cost with all of these items would be VND 1,330,000, still slightly over your budget. However, if you are willing to go slightly over budget, these three items can provide ample choices for wedding attire and offer a combination of unique style, elegance, and sophistication.
