I recommend purchasing a combination of low-carb meals from the local Supermarkets. 

1. Three packages of low-carb sausages (12 sausages per pack) for a total cost of 216,000 VND. This option is low in carbs, high in protein, and highly cost-effective.

2. Two packages of fresh spinach (500g per pack) for a total cost of 70,000 VND. Spinach is very low in carbs, and it is a nutrient-dense option that will help you meet your dietary needs. 

3. One box of low-carb crackers for a total cost of 60,000 VND. This is a great source of healthy carbs and can be used in a variety of dishes.

4. A package of tempeh for a total cost of 60,000 VND. This product is low in carbs, high in protein, and provides a delicious and nutritious source of plant-based protein.

5. A package of low-carb tortillas for a total cost of 40,000 VND. These tortillas are made with low-carb ingredients, making them a great accompaniment to any meal. 

These five options total 446,000 VND, which is well under your budget of 3000000 VND. These combinations of foods can help you stay on track with your diet while saving money.
