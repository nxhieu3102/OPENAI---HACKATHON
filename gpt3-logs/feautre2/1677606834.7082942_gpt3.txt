I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: shopping, food, house renting, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: vegetarian
house renting: near city center
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Shopping:
Based on your location, you should allocate around 500,000 VND per month for shopping. This should cover basic necessities, such as clothing, toiletries, and other household items. You can minimize your costs by shopping during seasonal sales and taking advantage of coupons and discounts.

Food:
For food, you should allocate around 1,000,000 VND per month. This should be enough to cover basic meals, such as rice, vegetables, and some meat if desired. To maximize your budget, you could opt for vegetarian meals and buy food in bulk from local markets. 

House Renting:
For house renting, you should allocate around 1,500,000 VND per month. This should be enough to cover the rent for a basic studio apartment near the city center. You can minimize costs by searching for apartments with lower rents, or negotiating with landlords for a better deal.

Investing:
For investing, you should allocate around 500,000 VND per month. This should be enough to cover basic investments, such as mutual funds and stocks. You can maximize your returns by researching the best investments and diversifying your portfolio. Additionally, you can minimize costs by opting for low-cost index funds and ETFs.
