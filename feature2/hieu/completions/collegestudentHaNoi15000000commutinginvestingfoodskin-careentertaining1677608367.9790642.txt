Commuting: Use public transportation such as buses, trams or trains to save money. Depending on my location, the cost of a monthly pass can range from 200,000 VND to 400,000 VND. 

Investing: Investing in the stock market or mutual funds is a great way to increase wealth over the long-term. Invest a small percentage of my budget (around 5-10%) in a low-cost index fund or ETF. 

Food: Since you are a vegetarian, opt for plant-based meals that are more affordable than meat-based dishes. Look for grocery stores that offer discounts on certain items and take advantage of coupons. Consider creating meal plans in advance to save money. 

Skin-Care: Invest in quality skin-care products that are tailored to your skin type and needs. Try to find natural and organic products that are free of harsh chemicals. Look for sales and discounts on the products you need.

Entertaining: Try to minimize the amount of money spent on drinking and cooking. Explore your city and look for free activities or events to attend. Consider eating out with friends, but try to find restaurants that offer discounts or coupons.
