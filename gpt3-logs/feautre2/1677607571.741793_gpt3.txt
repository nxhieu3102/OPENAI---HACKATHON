I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: skin-care, shopping, food, commuting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: can not cook
commuting: 3 km to work
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin Care: 10000 VND per month 
This amount is enough to cover basic skin care needs and will not break your budget. Consider investing in a good quality skin care product that will last you a while and will not need to be replaced often.

Shopping: 25000 VND per month 
This amount is enough to cover basic shopping needs such as clothing and other necessities. Consider setting aside a portion of this budget to purchase items that can be used for a long time, such as a quality backpack or pair of shoes. 

Food: 200000 VND per month 
This amount is enough to cover basic food needs for one month. Consider using this budget to purchase groceries that are both nutritious and affordable. Also, look for budget-friendly restaurants and cafes in the area to maximize your budget. 

Commuting: 20000 VND per month 
This amount is enough to cover basic commuting needs for a 3 km trip. Consider investing in a bicycle to save money on transportation costs. Alternatively, consider using public transportation such as buses or trains to save money in the long run.
