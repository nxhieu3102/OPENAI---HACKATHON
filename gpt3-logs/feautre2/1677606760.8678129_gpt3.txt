I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: house renting, food, investing, shopping, entertaining
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: near city center
food: can not cook
entertaining: traveling, go backpacking
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: 20% of the budget (or 600,000 VND). Look for a house near city centre that is affordable and within your budget. Check for rent discounts or other incentives that can help you save money.

Food: 40% of the budget (or 1,200,000 VND). Visit local restaurants, supermarkets, or street food vendors to get the best bang for your buck. Look for deals or discounts that can help you save money on food. Also, consider using food delivery services to save time and money.

Investing: 10% of the budget (or 300,000 VND). Invest in stocks, mutual funds, or other low-risk investments that can provide a steady return over time. Consider investing in index funds as they provide a low-cost, diversified portfolio.

Shopping: 10% of the budget (or 300,000 VND). Invest in essential items such as clothes, shoes, and other accessories that you may need. Look for discounts and buy items on sale to save money.

Entertaining: 20% of the budget (or 600,000 VND). Spend this money on activities such as backpacking, going to the movies, or visiting tourist sites. Look for discounts or coupons to save money.

Overall, this spending plan should help you stay within your budget while still allowing you to enjoy the best that Ho Chi Minh City has to offer. Consider setting aside a portion of your budget for emergency expenses and unexpected costs. This will help you stay on track with your financial goals.
