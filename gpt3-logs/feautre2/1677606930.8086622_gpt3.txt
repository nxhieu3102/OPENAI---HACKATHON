I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: commuting, investing, food, shopping, skin-care
Specific constraints for each demand: 
commuting: 3 km to work
food: vegetarian
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Commuting: Using public transport or bike to commute is recommended as it is more cost-effective and eco-friendly. Allocating around 400,000 VND per month for transportation costs should be sufficient.

Investing: Investing in stocks, mutual funds, and real estate can be beneficial for long-term financial stability. Allocating around 500,000 VND per month for such investments should be sufficient.

Food: Shopping for groceries at local markets or online can help to save money. Allocating around 500,000 VND per month for groceries should be sufficient.

Shopping: Shopping for clothes, accessories, and other items at local stores or online can help to save money. Allocating around 300,000 VND per month for shopping should be sufficient.

Skin Care: Investing in quality skin care products can help to improve skin health and appearance. Allocating around 800,000 VND per month for skin care should be sufficient. 

Overall, a total budget of 3000000 VND per month can be used to cover the five demands that the user has specified. By following the suggested spending plan, the user should be able to make their money stretch while still meeting their needs.
