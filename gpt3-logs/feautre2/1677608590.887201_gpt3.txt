I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: investing, skin-care, entertaining, shopping
Specific constraints for each demand:

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Investing: 
Allocate 10,000,000 VND to investing. Investing in stocks is generally a good long-term strategy and can help you build wealth over time. Investing in a mutual fund or index fund can be a good way to diversify your portfolio and protect against market volatility.

Skin-Care: 
Allocate 1,500,000 VND to skin-care. Da Nang is a humid climate and the sun is strong, so make sure to prioritize sunscreen and other skin protection products. Look for deals on skin-care products in local stores or online.

Entertaining:
Allocate 2,500,000 VND to entertaining. This should be enough for a few nights out with friends, going to coffee, or other activities. Use this as an opportunity to explore the city and enjoy the local culture!

Shopping: 
Allocate 1,000,000 VND to shopping. Da Nang has many great markets, so you should be able to find bargains. Look for cheap yet high-quality items like clothes and accessories. This could also be a great opportunity to buy gifts for friends and family.

This budget should be enough to cover all of your demands while still staying within your total budget of 15,000,000 VND. Make sure to prioritize investing and skin-care, as these are essential expenses that will help you reach your long-term financial goals. Have fun and enjoy your time in Da Nang!
