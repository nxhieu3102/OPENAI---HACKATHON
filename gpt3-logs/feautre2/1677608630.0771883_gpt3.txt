Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Entertaining: 
For entertaining, allocate 40% of your budget or 6,000,000 VND. To maximize the budget for entertaining, consider going camping or exploring the city of Da Nang. You can also save money by going on day trips instead of spending money on a hotel. Additionally, you could look for discounted tickets to local attractions or take advantage of free outdoor activities such as going to the beach, visiting parks, or exploring the city.

Education:
For education, allocate 40% of your budget or 6,000,000 VND. To maximize the budget for education, look for discounted classes or workshops in the area. Additionally, consider taking online courses that are offered at discounted prices. You can also look for free educational activities such as lectures or events that may be available in your area.

Shopping:
For shopping, allocate the remaining 20% of your budget or 3,000,000 VND. To maximize this budget, look for discounts and sales when shopping. Additionally, consider buying items in bulk to save money. You can also look for second-hand items that may be cheaper than buying new. Additionally, look for online discounts or coupons that can help you save money.
