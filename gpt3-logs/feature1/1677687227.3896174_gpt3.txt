ANSWER: 

==========

1. 500gr chicken breast, 250gr beans, 300gr broccoli: 700.000 VND. 
This meal provides a good source of protein, low-carb and within your budget. Chicken is a good source of lean protein and is low in carbs. Beans and broccoli are both good sources of fiber, vitamins and minerals without carbs (or very low carbs). 

2. 150gr pork, 100gr noodles, 400gr carrots: 700.000 VND.
This is a low-carb meal that fits within your budget. Pork is a good source of protein and is low in carbs. Noodles are low-carb and also provide a good source of vitamins and minerals. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, yet extremely low in carbs.
