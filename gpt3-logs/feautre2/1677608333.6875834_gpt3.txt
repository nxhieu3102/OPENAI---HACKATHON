I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: investing, house renting, skin-care, playing sport
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: not far from city center
playing sport: football or badminton
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Investing: Allocate 2,000,000 VND for investing. Investing will provide the user with long-term financial security and growth. Consider investing in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and other financial instruments in order to maximize returns.

House Renting: Allocate 4,000,000 VND for house renting. House renting is essential for living in Da Nang. Look for a house close to the city center, as it will provide more convenience and may be cheaper. 

Skin-Care: Allocate 1,500,000 VND for skin-care. Skin-care is not essential, but it can improve the user's confidence and overall well-being. Look for affordable and effective skin-care products.

Playing Sport: Allocate 2,500,000 VND for playing sport. Playing sport can help the user stay fit and healthy. Consider playing football or badminton, as these two sports are relatively inexpensive and can provide great exercise. 

Total: 10,000,000 VND
