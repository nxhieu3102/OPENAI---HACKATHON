I would recommend purchasing the following items in order to optimize your budget, meet the conditions, and still provide you with enough food for your needs: 

1. Five packs of soya mince (150,000 VND): This vegan soy product is high in protein, is great for making a variety of dishes including chili, tacos, stir-fries and more, and is a good source of sustenance. It also contains no cholesterol. 

2. Package of quinoa (125,000 VND): Quinoa is also a vegan source of protein and packed full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Quinoa is also a complex carb so it provides long lasting energy and satiety. 

3. Package of dates (110,000 VND): Dates are naturally sweet and can be used as a vegan alternative to butter or sugar. They are rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals and help to promote healthy digestion.

4. Package of chickpeas (100,000 VND): Chickpeas are a good vegan source of protein and are a great addition to salads and curries. The high fibre content helps aid digestion and they are low in calories.

5. Two packages of avocado (220,000 VND): Avocado is full of healthy fats, vitamins and minerals and is a tasty and nutritious vegan option. It can be added to salads, sandwiches or blended into smoothies and guacamole. 

Total Cost: 705,000 VND, under your budget.
