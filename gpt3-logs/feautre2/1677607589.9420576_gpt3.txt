I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, investing, commuting, entertaining
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: gyming, dancing
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
entertaining: drinking, cooking
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing sport: 
For playing sport, you can join a gym in your area for a monthly fee of around 1,000,000 VND. This will allow you access to a wide range of equipment to work out with and help you stay fit. You can also consider joining a dance class, which can cost around 500,000 VND per month. This will help you learn new dance moves and stay active.

Investing:
Investing is an important part of a financial plan and can help you build wealth over time. Investing in stocks, mutual funds, and other financial products can be done through either a broker or a DIY platform. For the DIY platform, you can invest around 500,000 VND per month. For the broker, you can invest around 1,000,000 VND per month.

Commuting:
Commuting to and from work or school can be a major cost for many people. To keep costs down, you can use public transportation, such as buses and trains, or rent a bicycle. Both of these options are quite cheap and should not exceed 500,000 VND per month.

Entertaining:
Entertaining yourself doesn't have to be expensive. You can save money while still having fun by cooking at home, going to the movies, or going out to eat with friends. For cooking at home, you can allocate around 500,000 VND per month. For going out to eat with friends, you can set aside around 500,000 VND per month. For the movies, you can allocate around 200,000 VND per month.

Final Spending Plan:
Playing sport: 1,000,000 VND
Investing: 500,000 VND
Commuting: 500,000 VND
Entertaining: 700,000 VND

Total Spending: 2,700,000 VND

By following this spending plan, you will be able to meet all of your demands while still staying within your budget. While the plan does not account for any unexpected expenses, it should provide you with enough flexibility to account for any changes in your financial situation.
