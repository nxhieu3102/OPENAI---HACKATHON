I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 6000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: skin-care, shopping, playing sport, house renting, education
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: football or badminton
house renting: cheap motel
education: programming learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin Care: 2,000,000 VND 
This is a non-essential expense that should be considered after other essential needs are met. However, it is important to take care of your skin. Allocate 2,000,000 VND to buy skin care products.

Shopping: 1,500,000 VND 
Shopping is also a non-essential expense. However, consider 1,500,000 VND to buy necessary items for living. Make sure to look for deals and discounts to ensure you get the best value for your money.

Playing Sport: 500,000 VND 
As Da Nang is a coastal city, you can save money by playing sports outdoors. Allocate 500,000 VND to buy equipment such as footballs, badminton rackets, and nets.

House Renting: 2,000,000 VND 
This is an essential expense, as you need somewhere to live. Consider allocating 2,000,000 VND for a cheap motel. Look for deals and discounts to get the best value for your money.

Education: 500,000 VND 
This is also an essential expense, and you need to invest in your future. Allocate 500,000 VND to enroll in a programming learning program. Consider online courses as they are often more affordable and offer more flexibility. 

Total: 6,000,000 VND 

By following this plan, you can stay within your budget and make sure that your essential expenses are taken care of. With the remaining funds, you can allocate them to skin care, shopping, and other non-essential expenses.
