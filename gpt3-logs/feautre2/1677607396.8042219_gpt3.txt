I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, skin-care, entertaining, house renting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: football or badminton
entertaining: drinking, cooking
house renting: not far from city center
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Sports:
Allocate 1,000,000 VND for sports activities. This amount should cover the cost of joining a football or badminton club in your city, or the cost of any other sport you may want to pursue. It may also include the cost of purchasing any necessary equipment. 

Skin-care:
Allocate 500,000 VND for skin-care products and treatments. This amount should cover the cost of any products you may need to maintain healthy skin, as well as the cost of any treatments you may want to pursue. 

Entertaining:
Allocate 700,000 VND for entertaining activities. This amount should cover the cost of going out for drinks or meals with friends, as well as the cost of any ingredients needed for cooking. 

House Renting:
Allocate 300,000 VND for house renting. This amount should cover the cost of renting a room that is not too far from the city center. 

In conclusion, the optimal spending plan should allocate 1,000,000 VND for sports activities, 500,000 VND for skin-care products and treatments, 700,000 VND for entertaining activities, and 300,000 VND for house renting. This spending plan should be able to maximize the budget while ensuring the user stays within their budget constraints and prioritizes essential expenses over non-essential expenses. Additionally, this spending plan should also account for market prices in the user's city, as well as help the user optimize for long-term financial stability.
