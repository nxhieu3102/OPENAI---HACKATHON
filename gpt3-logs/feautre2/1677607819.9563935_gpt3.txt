I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 4000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: education, food, skin-care
Specific constraints for each demand: 
education: drawing, cooking
food: high protein
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Education:
Allocate 500,000 VND for drawing classes and 500,000 VND for cooking classes. This will allow you to stay within your budget and provide a comprehensive education.

Food:
Allocate 1,500,000 VND for high protein food. This will ensure that you get enough protein in your diet while staying within your budget.

Skin-Care:
Allocate 2,000,000 VND for skin-care products and services. This will provide an adequate supply of skin-care products while staying within your budget.

Schema for each demand that maximizes my budget:

Education: 
Choose affordable classes offered by local schools or universities. Research online for discounts or coupons that could help reduce the cost.

Food: 
Choose high-protein foods with the lowest price tag. Look for seasonal discounts or look for bulk-buying options.

Skin-Care:
Choose skin-care products that are within your budget but still provide the desired results. Look for coupons or discounts on products. Consider making your own skin-care products from natural ingredients to save money.
