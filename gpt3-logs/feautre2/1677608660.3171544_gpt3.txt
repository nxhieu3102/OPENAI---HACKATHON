I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, skin-care, commuting, education, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: calories reduce
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
education: programming learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: 8,000,000 VND 

This is the highest cost category and the most essential one. Spend on healthy, nutrient-dense foods that will keep your body energized and functioning optimally. Look for discounts and specials at local markets and grocery stores. Consider preparing meals at home using local ingredients to reduce costs further.

Skin Care: 2,000,000 VND 

Invest in quality skin care products that are tailored to your skin type. Look for natural ingredients whenever possible. Look for specials and discounts to help you save money.

Commuting: 4,000,000 VND

Invest in a reliable motorbike to ensure a safe and efficient journey to and from school. Consider the cost of repair and maintenance when calculating the cost of the motorbike.

Education: 1,000,000 VND

Prioritize learning materials and tools that will help you reach your educational goals. Look for free online resources or discounts on educational materials.

Investing: 500,000 VND

Investing may not be an immediate need, but it is important for long-term financial stability. Think about investing in a diversified portfolio of low-risk investments such as mutual funds and bonds. Research the different types of investments available before investing your money.
