Commuting:
Allocate 5000000 VND for commuting. As you are only commuting 3 km to work, you can opt for a cheaper form of transport such as a bicycle, scooter, or bus. This will help you save money on transportation costs.

Skin-care:
For skin-care, allocate 2.5 million VND. This should cover basic skin-care products such as cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens. You can also save money by opting for generic brands, or purchasing in bulk from a wholesaler.

Investing:
Allocate 4 million VND for investing. This could be used for investing in stocks, building a portfolio of mutual funds, or investing in a retirement account. Do your research and select the best option for your financial goals.

Shopping:
Allocate 3.5 million VND for shopping. Try to stick to basic items and purchase only what is necessary. Consider shopping around for the best deal and compare prices to get the best value for your money.

Overall, this budget plan should help you stay within your budget and meet your needs. Remember to prioritize essential expenses over non-essential expenses, minimize costs where possible, and optimize for long-term financial stability.
