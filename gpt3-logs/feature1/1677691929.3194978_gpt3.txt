Your best option would be to look into a studio apartment in Da Nang. This option is usually cozy, yet quite affordable and allows you to customize the interior and personalize your space without breaking the bank. 
Their prices can vary depending on the location and size of the apartment. The price range for a studio apartment in Da Nang is about 800USD-1,200USD. Most studio apartments come with solar hot water, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Some even come with fully equipped kitchens, including appliances such as a refrigerator, stove, and washing machine. 
You can customize the interior of the apartment by adding wall decors and accessories that best suit your style and personality. This allows you to make the apartment feel unique and cozy - as if it were you own.

Furthermore, an added benefit of buying a studio apartment in Da Nang is its potential to gain returns on the investment. With a bit of renovations, and specific marketing, itâ€™s possible to rent the apartment to increase your income. This allows you to recoup the initial cost of the studio apartment, make a return on your investment, and still have a cozy and personalized house.
