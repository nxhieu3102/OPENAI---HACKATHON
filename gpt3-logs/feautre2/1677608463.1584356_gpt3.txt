I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: house renting, shopping, skin-care, commuting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: not far from city center
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: 6000000 VND (40% of budget)
Look for a house near the city center that is within your budget. You can even negotiate with the landlord and try to get a discounted rate.

Shopping: 4000000 VND (27% of budget)
Set aside a budget for items such as food, clothing, books, and other essentials. Try to buy items in bulk and shop during sales to maximize your savings.

Skin-care: 3000000 VND (20% of budget)
Invest in quality skin-care products that will last you longer. Consider items such as face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen for a good skin-care routine.

Commuting: 2000000 VND (13% of budget)
Take public transportation as much as possible to save on costs. Make sure to check the bus/train fares to ensure that you are getting the best deal.
