Total budget: 4000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: skin-care, house renting, playing sport
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: suburban area

Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin Care: 2,000,000 VND
Allocating 2,000,000 VND for skin care will give you the opportunity to purchase quality products that are tailored to your skin-care needs. You can also use this money to visit a dermatologist if needed.

House Renting: 1,500,000 VND
For house renting, it is recommended to focus on finding a place in a suburban area, which is likely to be cheaper than living in the city centre. Look for rental options that include utilities and other amenities to save on costs.

Playing Sport: 500,000 VND
Playing sport is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, however it does not have to be expensive. To maximize your budget, consider joining a gym or taking up a sport that does not require expensive equipment, such as running or dancing. Alternatively, you could purchase a gym membership or register for a dance class to get access to more activities. 

As you can see, by allocating your budget wisely, you can still enjoy a healthy lifestyle while staying within your budget constraints. Furthermore, this spending plan will help you to save money in the long run, ensuring that you remain financially stable.
