I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 6000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: shopping, playing sport, house renting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: gyming, dancing
house renting: suburban area
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Shopping: 40% of 6000000 VND (~2400000 VND): Look for cheaper shopping options, such as online stores or thrift stores, to maximize your budget. Consider shopping in bulk for items that will last you a long time.

Playing Sport: 30% of 6000000 VND (~1800000 VND): Invest in a gym membership, or try to find good deals on classes or equipment to help you save money. You can also look into different group activities, such as yoga or dance classes, to help cut down costs.

House Renting: 30% of 6000000 VND (~1800000 VND): Focus on finding a rental in a suburban area that fits your budget. Consider renting a room in a shared house or apartment to minimize costs. Additionally, look into longer-term rental agreements, as they may provide discounts.
