Education: IELTS Learning - 2,000,000 VND
Given that IELTS Learning is an essential expense, I should allocate a majority of my budget towards this. Furthermore, living in Hanoi gives me the flexibility to look for cheaper alternatives such as online courses and other study materials.

Food: Calories Reduce - 200,000 VND
Given that food is an essential expense, I should allocate a portion of my budget towards healthy food items that reduce calories. Since I am living in Hanoi, I can take advantage of the local markets and street food for cheaper options.

Skin-care: 100,000 VND
Since skin-care is a non-essential expense, I should allocate a smaller portion of my budget towards this. I should prioritize natural and organic skin-care products over more expensive, chemical-based products.

Commuting: 3 km to work - 300,000 VND
Given that commuting is an essential expense, I should allocate a portion of my budget towards this. I should look into public transport options such as buses and trains to reduce my commuting costs. I can also consider bicycle or electric scooter options if available.

Overall, I should allocate 2,000,000 VND for education, 200,000 VND for food, 100,000 VND for skin-care, and 300,000 VND for commuting. This way, I will be able to stay within my budget constraints and still be able to meet my essential needs.
