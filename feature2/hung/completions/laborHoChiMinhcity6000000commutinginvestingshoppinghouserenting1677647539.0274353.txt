Commuting: 
Given the 15 km distance, public transportation should be the most cost-effective option. To maximize your budget, consider using a prepaid transportation card to get discounted fares. Allocate up to 10% of your budget or 600,000 VND for this need.

Investing: 
Investing is an important part of long-term financial stability and should be prioritized. Allocate up to 40% of your budget or 2,400,000 VND for this need and consider investing in low-risk instruments such as mutual funds, bonds, and index funds.

Shopping: 
Shopping is not essential and should be prioritized after investing, so allocate up to 30% of your budget or 1,800,000 VND for this need. Research the prices of items you need to purchase in advance and look for discounts to maximize your budget.

House Renting: 
Given that you want to stay close to the city center, it is important to research the market prices for rental properties in the area to ensure that you donâ€™t overspend. Allocate up to 20% of your budget or 1,200,000 VND for this need.
