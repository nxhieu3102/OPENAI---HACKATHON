Commuting:
Optimal Spending: 5,000,000 VND

House Renting:
Optimal Spending: 5,500,000 VND
Schema: Look for rental housing in suburban areas. This will generally be cheaper than options in the city center and will give you more options to choose from. Check out online rental platforms such as Craigslist or Facebook rental groups for potential listings.

Entertaining:
Optimal Spending: 2,500,000 VND
Schema: Prioritize going backpacking for cheaper entertainment options. Look for budget-friendly hostels or hotels in nearby cities or countries. Also, plan ahead and book tickets ahead of time to get better rates.

Food:
Optimal Spending: 1,500,000 VND
Schema: Stick to vegetarian food for a more cost-effective option. Look for local eateries or street food stalls that are known for their vegetarian dishes. Also, consider preparing meals at home instead of eating out to save money.
