I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: education, food, shopping, investing, house renting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
education: toeic learning
food: can not cook
house renting: not far from city center
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Education: 6000000 VND - Invest in quality online TOEIC learning programs, such as TOEIC Bridge or TOEIC Practice Test Online, which are affordable and offer good value for money.

Food: 2000000 VND - Focus on healthy and affordable options such as convenience store meals, fruit and vegetables, and frozen meals. Avoid spending too much on take-out or restaurant meals, as these can quickly add up.

Shopping: 2000000 VND - Shop for essential items such as toiletries and groceries online and in-store, and look for discounts and sales to help you save money.

Investing: 0 VND - Investing is not a necessity at this stage and should be avoided until you have more financial stability.

House Renting: 2000000 VND - Look for a place close to city center that fits your budget. Consider looking for shared accommodations if possible, as this can significantly lower your housing costs.
