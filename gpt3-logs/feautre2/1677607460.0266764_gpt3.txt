I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: house renting, food, investing, education, entertaining
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: suburban area
food: high protein
education: programming learning
entertaining: party, go to coffee
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: Suburban area, budget should be around 1200000 VND. 
Food: High protein food can be a bit costly but you can get good quality food within the range of 600000-800000 VND. 
Investing: Investing in stocks, mutual funds and other financial products can be a good way to get long-term financial stability. Investing around 200000-400000 VND could be a good start. 
Education: Programming learning can be done through online courses and digital resources, which are relatively affordable. Investing around 200000-300000 VND for online courses can be a good option. 
Entertaining: Parties and going to coffee can be done within the range of 200000-400000 VND. 

Overall, this spending plan should help you maximize your budget while still meeting your demands. Make sure to prioritize essential expenses over non-essential ones, minimize costs wherever possible, and optimize for long-term financial stability.
