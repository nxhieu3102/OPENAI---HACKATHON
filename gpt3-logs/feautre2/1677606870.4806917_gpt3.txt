Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Shopping: Allocate 25% of the budget, or 750,000 VND, towards shopping expenses. Consider cutting back on non-essential items such as clothes and accessories and instead focus on purchasing items that are necessary for everyday living. 

Investing: Allocate 10% of the budget, or 300,000 VND, towards investing. Investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other financial instruments can be a great way to grow your money over time. 

Food: Allocate 30% of the budget, or 900,000 VND, towards food expenses. Make sure to focus on high protein foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. Additionally, consider shopping at local markets to find deals on fresh produce. 

Entertaining: Allocate 15% of the budget, or 450,000 VND, towards entertaining expenses. This can be used to fund trips and backpacking trips.
