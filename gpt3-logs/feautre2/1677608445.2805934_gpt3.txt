==========

House Renting: 6000000 VND (40%)
For house renting, you should prioritize finding a place near the city center in order to reduce commute time and related costs. Look for listings with reasonable rent prices and negotiate if possible. This way, you can ensure that you are getting the most value for your money.

Investing: 4000000 VND (27%)
Investing is a great way to grow your wealth over time. Start by researching different investment options and making informed decisions. You can start small by investing in mutual funds or other low-risk options. As your budget expands, you can consider higher-risk investments that have the potential to generate higher returns.

Skin-Care: 5000000 VND (33%)
For skin-care, you should focus on finding products that will be most effective for your skin type and budget. Research which products are best for your skin type and consider buying items in bulk if possible to save money. Don't forget to protect your skin from the sun by using a sunscreen with a high SPF rating.
