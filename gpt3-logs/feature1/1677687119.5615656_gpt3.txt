1. Ha Huy Giang: Vang Ngọc Châu Duc Bảo Đức (1,200,000 VND): This deep-bodied and full-bodied red wine has intense aromas of blackberry, tar and leather. Its intense yet balanced tannins are complemented by aromas of autumn fruit, minerals and sweet spices. This bottle is the perfect companion for grilled salmon’s complex, nutty taste. 

2. Sinsin: Vang Rousse (300,000 VND): Richly structured and intense, this wine has aromas of leather, blackberry and mushroom on the nose. Its flavors are balanced and deep, providing a great companion to the complex flavors of grilled salmon.
