I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: shopping, entertaining, commuting, education
Specific constraints for each demand: 
entertaining: theater and concerts
commuting: 15 km by public transportation

Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible

Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:
