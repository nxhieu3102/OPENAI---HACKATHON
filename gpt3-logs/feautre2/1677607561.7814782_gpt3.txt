I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: skin-care, food, education, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: can not cook
education: toeic learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin Care: Allocate 600,000 VND for skin care. This should cover the cost of basic skin care items such as face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen. 

Food: Allocate 900,000 VND for food. This will cover the cost of eating out or ordering food in, which can be significantly cheaper than cooking. 

Education: Allocate 800,000 VND for TOEIC learning. This should cover the cost of materials, practice tests, and any other fees associated with the process.

Investing: Allocate 200,000 VND for investing. This should cover the cost of basic financial investing, such as stocks or mutual funds. It may also be possible to use this budget to open a savings account and start building up a savings cushion.

Schema:

Skin Care: Try to buy items at a discounted rate, such as on sale or during promotions. Look for products that meet your needs without breaking the bank.

Food: Try to minimize costs by eating out or ordering in. Consider whether it is cost-effective to cook meals from scratch. 

Education: Utilize online resources for TOEIC learning. Look for free or discounted materials, and consider taking practice tests online. 

Investing: Start with a small initial investment such as stocks or mutual funds. Consider investing in a savings account to start building a cushion for future expenses. Research different options to find the right fit for your budget.
