I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: investing, education, house renting, food
Specific constraints for each demand: 
education: toeic learning
house renting: near city center
food: can not cook
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Investing: 3500000 VND 
Investing is an important part of any budget, and should be given a higher priority. This amount should be allocated to an appropriate investment strategy that can provide long-term financial stability. 

Education: 3000000 VND 
This amount should be used to pay for TOEIC learning materials, practice tests and other resources that will help you improve your skills. 

House Renting: 3000000 VND 
This amount should be used to rent a house near the city center. The exact amount will depend on the size of the house and the location. 

Food: 1000000 VND 
This amount should be allocated to buying groceries and other food items. Eating out should be limited as much as possible, as it can be an expensive habit. 

By following this spending plan, you can ensure that your budget is optimized for long-term financial stability, while still allowing you to meet all of your demands. Additionally, by minimizing costs where possible and prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses, you will be able to stay within your budget constraints.
