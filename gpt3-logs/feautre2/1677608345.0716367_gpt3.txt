I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, commuting, investing, food
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: karate
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
food: calories reduce
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sport:
Budget Allocation: 3000000 VND 
Schema: Sign up for a karate class at a local dojo. The cost of the class will depend on the location and the length of the course. Try to find a course that provides the best value for your money.

Commuting:
Budget Allocation: 4000000 VND
Schema: To save money on commuting, try to use public transportation where possible. Invest in a monthly pass or a prepaid card to get a discounted rate. If possible, walk or bike if the destination is close by.

Investing:
Budget Allocation: 5000000 VND 
Schema: Investing your money can be a great way to make your money grow. There are several ways to do this. You can open a brokerage account and invest in stocks, mutual funds, and other investments. You can also open a savings account and make regular deposits to earn interest.

Food:
Budget Allocation: 3000000 VND
Schema: To reduce your food costs, try to buy in bulk when possible and cook at home as much as you can. Try to buy fresh, local produce and avoid processed foods, as they can be more expensive. To reduce your calorie intake, focus on eating smaller portions and avoiding sugary and fried foods.
