Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sport:

For playing sport, you can allocate up to 500,000 VND. This should cover the costs of swimming and bicycling, such as the cost of access to a public swimming pool or a gym, the cost of a bicycle or renting one, and any additional gear or accessories you may need. To save money, look for discounts or offers, or consider joining a gym or pool that offers memberships at a discounted rate.

Commuting:

For commuting, you can allocate up to 800,000 VND. This should cover the cost of public transportation, such as bus or taxi fares. To save money, consider using a bike or walking where possible, or look for discounts or offers on bus and taxi fares.

Skin Care:

For skin care, you can allocate up to 1,200,000 VND. This should cover the cost of basic skin-care products, such as moisturizers and cleansers, as well as any additional treatments or procedures you may need. To save money, look for discounts or offers, or consider buying in bulk. Additionally, look for natural alternatives to expensive products.

In conclusion, the spending plan should be optimized to suit your needs and budget. With the above recommendations, you should be able to stay within your budget while also getting the most out of your money.
