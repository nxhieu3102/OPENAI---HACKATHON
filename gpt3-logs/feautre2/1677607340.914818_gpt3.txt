==========

Shopping:
To maximize your budget, look for discounts and sales when shopping. Try to find items that are of good quality and fit within your budget. Consider shopping at local vendors and farmersâ€™ markets to save on costs. You can also look for second-hand items or shop online for better deals.

Playing sport:
Karate is a form of martial arts that requires dedication and commitment. You can take classes at a local dojo and purchase the necessary equipment, such as a uniform and belt, for a reasonable price. There may also be free or low-cost workshops and events that you can attend.

Education:
Programming is an invaluable skill that can be learned for free or at a low cost. Consider taking an online course or attending a local coding bootcamp. You may also want to invest in books or other resources that can help guide your learning.

Entertaining:
Theater and concerts can be expensive, so try to find cheaper alternatives such as visiting a museum or gallery, attending a local music night, or watching a movie at home. You can also take advantage of student discounts when available.
