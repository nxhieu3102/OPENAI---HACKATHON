Entertaining:

Allocate 150000 VND for theater tickets and concerts. Try to buy tickets in advance for discounted prices. Look for local theater shows or musical performances instead of going to bigger venues. Look for discounted tickets and student discounts where possible.

House Renting:

Allocate 1000000 VND for rent. Look for apartments that are within a safe and convenient distance from the city center. Consider looking for shorter-term rentals and negotiating for discounted prices.

Skin Care:

Allocate 500000 VND for skin care. If you're on a budget, opt for basic skin care products that are proven to be effective. Look for natural and organic products, as they tend to be more affordable and less harsh on the skin. Invest in products that can be used both short-term and long-term, such as serums and moisturizers.
