I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, skin-care, shopping, entertaining, commuting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: swimming and bicycling
entertaining: traveling, go backpacking
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sport: 
Swimming: Allocate 600,000 VND per month for swimming classes. 
Bicycling: Allocate 300,000 VND per month for bicycle maintenance and use public transportation to commute instead of a personal bike. 

Skin-Care:
Allocate 300,000 VND per month for skin-care products. 

Shopping:
Allocate 500,000 VND per month for shopping.

Entertaining: 
Traveling: Allocate 1,000,000 VND per month for traveling. This should cover the costs associated with backpacking and other travel-related expenses.

Commuting: 
Allocate 500,000 VND per month for public transportation. This should cover the costs associated with commuting 15 km by public transportation each month. 

Total Budget: 3,000,000 VND

This spending plan will help you stay within your budget and optimize for long-term financial stability. Additionally, by living in Ha Noi, you will benefit from the lower market prices which will help you maximize your budget.
