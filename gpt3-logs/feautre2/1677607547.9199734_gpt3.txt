I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: commuting, house renting, shopping, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
house renting: suburban area
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Commuting: 
Cost: This can vary greatly depending on the distance of the commute, the type of transportation and the prices of petrol. A motorbike is the most economical option for commuting, and can cost around 1,000,000 VND per month including petrol.

Schema: To minimize costs, consider carpooling or taking public transport when possible. Consider investing in a bicycle or electric scooter to further reduce costs.

House Renting:
Cost: The cost of renting a house in a suburban area can range from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 VND per month.

Schema: Look for shared accommodation in order to reduce the cost of rent. Consider renting a room or apartment in a house, as this will usually be cheaper than renting a whole house.

Shopping: 
Cost: Shopping can vary greatly in cost. Depending on the items purchased, the cost can range from a few thousand VND to many millions of VND.

Schema: Shop around for the best deals and compare prices online. Make use of discount codes and sales. Look for second-hand items when possible.

Investing: 
Cost: Investing costs can vary depending on the type of asset and the amount invested. 

Schema: Consider investing in low-risk, long-term investments such as mutual funds, stocks and bonds. Research the market before investing and diversify your portfolio.

Final Spending Plan:

Commuting: 1,000,000 VND 
House Renting: 4,000,000 VND 
Shopping: 2,000,000 VND 
Investing: 500,000 VND 

Total: 7,500,000 VND
