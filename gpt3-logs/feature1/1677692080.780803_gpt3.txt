ANSWER: 

==========

Option 1: An fully-furnished 1-bedroom apartment located in the suburban area of Ho Chi Minh city is a great option to optimize your budget. The price of the apartment is about 450 million VND (around 20,000 USD) for the total cost and it offers modern furniture, decent neighborhood, and a mix of both urban & suburban life. It could provide you a comfortable living experience and give you value for what you invest. 

Option 2: If you're looking for something a bit more cost-effective, you may have to consider checking out older apartments located in outlying areas of Ho Chi Minh city. A 1-bed room apartment with basic furniture located in these areas would cost you around 300 million VND (or 14,000 USD) depending on the area. The benefit of these older apartments is that you will still enjoy a decent neighborhood, convenient stores & transportation, but you should keep in mind that the quality of the apartment might not be as good as the more expensive options. 

Both options above fit your budget and provide you the necessary living conditions, so you can choose either one to make your purchase.
