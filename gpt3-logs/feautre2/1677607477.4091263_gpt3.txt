I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, commuting, playing sport, house renting, education
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: vegetarian
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
playing sport: gyming, dancing
house renting: suburban area
education: ielts learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: Based on the fact that you are a vegetarian, you should allocate around 1,000,000 VND for food. You can optimize this by cooking your own meals and looking for discounts and deals from supermarkets or local markets.

Commuting: Since you will be commuting 10 km to school by motorbike, you should allocate around 600,000 VND for transport costs. This should cover the cost of fuel, maintenance and other related expenses. 

Playing Sport: You should allocate around 400,000 VND for playing sport. This should cover the cost of gym membership, equipment, and other related costs. 

House Renting: You should allocate around 800,000 VND for house renting. This should cover the cost of rent, utilities and other related expenses.

Education: You should allocate around 300,000 VND for IELTS learning. This should cover the cost of materials, classes, and other related expenses. 

Overall, your total budget should be around 2,500,000 VND and the optimal spending plan should be as follows: 
Food: 1,000,000 VND
Commuting: 600,000 VND
Playing Sport: 400,000 VND
House Renting: 800,000 VND
Education: 300,000 VND 

In order to optimize your budget, you should try to find deals and discounts when going out to eat, look for cheaper transportation options, and look for cheaper housing options. Additionally, you should prioritize essential expenses such as rent and food over non-essential expenses such as playing sport and IELTS learning. This will help to ensure that you stay within your budget constraints and still have enough money for essential expenses. Finally, when making your spending decisions, try to think about long-term financial stability and look for ways to save money in the long-term.
