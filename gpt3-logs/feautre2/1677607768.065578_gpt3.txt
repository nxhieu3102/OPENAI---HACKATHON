Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: 3000000 VND
In order to get the most value for your money, try to rent a cheap motel in the area. This will give you access to all the amenities you need while still being affordable. Look for a place that is close to public transportation and other services, as this will save you money on transportation costs.

Skin-Care: 500000 VND
Look for natural skin-care products that are made with natural ingredients and won't be too harsh on your skin. Invest in a few key products that will help you maintain healthy skin, such as a good face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen.

Playing Sport: 100000 VND
Since you are living in a city, you should focus on activities that you can do without needing much equipment. Swimming and bicycling are both great options for getting exercise without needing a lot of money. Invest in a good pair of swim goggles and a quality bike if you can afford it.

Investing: 100000 VND
Although investing is a great way to build wealth over time, it is important to be careful with your money. Start by setting aside some money each month to invest in a diversified portfolio. Look for investments that can provide you with long-term returns and make sure to do your research before making any decisions.
