For shopping, you should allocate at least 600,000 VND ($25 USD). This will allow you to purchase necessary items such as clothing and other essentials. To maximize your budget, it is best to shop at local markets where the prices are cheaper. Additionally, you should look for online deals and discounts when possible. 

Education:
For education, you should allocate at least 800,000 VND ($34 USD). This will allow you to purchase necessary materials for TOEIC learning such as books and online classes. To maximize your budget, it is best to look for deals and discounts available online. Additionally, you should take advantage of free resources available online such as practice tests and video tutorials. 

Skin-care:
For skin-care, you should allocate at least 400,000 VND ($17 USD). This will allow you to purchase basic skin-care products such as cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens.
