Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: education, shopping, playing sport, entertaining, skin-care
Specific constraints for each demand:

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price

Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Education: 
Allocate approximately 1,500,000 VND for programming learning. This amount should be enough to cover necessary material costs such as textbooks and online courses. Additionally, try to find free resources online and look for discounted prices on textbooks. 

Playing Sport:
Allocate approximately 500,000 VND for gym membership and/or dance classes. This should be enough to cover the cost of several months of gym membership or several dance lessons. 

Shopping: 
Allocate approximately 500,000 VND for shopping. As you live in Hanoi, this should be enough to cover clothing, accessories, and other items that you may need. Make sure to compare prices between different stores to get the best deals.

Entertaining:
Allocate approximately 500,000 VND for entertainment. This should be enough to cover going out to movies, eating out, or any other activities you may want to do in your free time. Try to look for discounts and other promotions to save money. 

Skin-care: 
Allocate approximately 500,000 VND for skin-care. This should be enough to cover the cost of basic skin-care products such as cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Make sure to do your research and look for the best products that fit your budget.
