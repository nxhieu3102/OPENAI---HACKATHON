==========

House Renting: 
Budget Allocation: 1,500,000 VND 
Schema: Try to find a house near the city center, preferably in a low-cost area. Avoid signing long-term leases and opt for a month-to-month contract if possible. Consider sharing a house with roommates to save on costs.

Skin-Care: 
Budget Allocation: 700,000 VND 
Schema: Stick to buying generic, over-the-counter skin-care products as they are typically cheaper than name brand items. Buy in bulk to save money, and consider making your own products such as facial masks and moisturizers. 

Investing: 
Budget Allocation: 500,000 VND 
Schema: Invest in low-risk stocks and bonds to minimize risk and maximize returns. Research the stock market before investing, and diversify your investments to ensure that you are not putting all of your eggs in one basket. 

Playing Sports: 
Budget Allocation: 300,000 VND 
Schema: Try to find a gym or sports club that offers discounts for students. Look for a gym with a pool and a cycling facility to make the most of your budget. Additionally, consider engaging in outdoor activities that do not require a membership such as jogging or bike riding. 

By following this optimized spending plan, you should be able to meet your financial needs without breaking your budget. Additionally, the strategies provided should help you maximize your budget and save money in the long run.
