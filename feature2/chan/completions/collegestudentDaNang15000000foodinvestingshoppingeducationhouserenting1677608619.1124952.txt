Investing: 
For investing, I would recommend allocating 2,000,000 VND per month. This should be done in order to secure your financial future by investing in stocks or mutual funds. A good way to maximize this budget would be to invest in index funds or ETFs, which provide long-term returns with low fees.

For education, I would recommend allocating 3,000,000 VND per month. This should be used for programing courses and other educational materials. To maximize this budget, consider attending online courses and leveraging free online resources. 

House Renting: 
For house renting, I would recommend allocating 7,500,000 VND per month. This should cover a suburban area house. To maximize this budget, consider looking for roommates to share the cost of rent. Additionally, look for areas that are close to public transportation, as this could help you save money on transportation costs.
