Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin-care: 1500000 VND
This amount covers basic skin-care needs and allows you to purchase products such as cleansers, toners, moisturizers, and serums. You can opt to buy cheaper products or stretch your budget further with higher-end products. 

Commuting: 600000 VND
This amount allows you to purchase a motorbike and maintain it for the duration of your college stay. You can consider cheaper options such as secondhand motorbikes. Make sure to factor in money for fuel and other related expenses.

House Renting: 2000000 VND
You can look for accommodation near the city center, which will give you easy access to your college and other amenities. This amount should cover rent, utilities, and other related costs. 

Playing Sport: 500000 VND
This amount should cover the cost of joining a karate class and purchasing related equipment. You may also opt to allocate some of this amount for other sports and recreational activities. 

Overall, this spending plan should provide you with sufficient funds to meet your demands and stay within your budget. Make sure to factor in all possible expenses and review your spending regularly to ensure that you are staying on track.
