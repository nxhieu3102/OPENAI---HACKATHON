I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: education, commuting, skin-care, house renting, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
education: drawing, cooking
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
house renting: cheap motel
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Education: Drawing - 1000 VND/session, cooking - 800 VND/session. Allocate a total of 600,000 VND/month to cover both of these activities. 

Commuting: Allocate a total of 500,000 VND/month to cover the cost of commuting 10 km to school, by motorbike. 

Skin Care: Allocate a total of 100,000 VND/month to cover basic skin care needs.

House Renting: Allocate a total of 1,500,000 VND/month to cover the costs of a cheap motel. 

Investing: Allocate a total of 300,000 VND/month to cover investing needs. 

This spending plan provides a balance between essential expenses and non-essential expenses, which maximizes your budget for these five demands. Additionally, by allocating a specific amount for each demand and prioritizing essential expenses, you can ensure long-term financial stability.
