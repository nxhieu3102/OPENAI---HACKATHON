Commuting: 
Considering your commuting needs and budget constraints, you should aim to spend no more than 200,000 VND per month on transportation. You should look for cost-effective transportation options like public transportation, bike-sharing, or carpooling. This will help you save money while still ensuring that you can get to work on time.

Skin care:
You should allocate around 300,000 VND for skincare. Look for budget-friendly products that are effective and safe for your skin. Consider buying products in bulk or using coupons to get discounts. Additionally, look for natural remedies like homemade masks or scrubs that you can make yourself.

Investing:
You should aim to invest at least 500,000 VND a month. There are many ways to invest your money, including stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Research the different investment options available to you and create an investment plan that fits your needs and budget.

For your IELTS learning, you should allocate around 1,000,000 VND. Research the different IELTS preparation courses available and look for the one that is best suited to your needs and budget. Additionally, look for online resources such as online practice tests, forums, and study guides that can help you prepare for the exam.
