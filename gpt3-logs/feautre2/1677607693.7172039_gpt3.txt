I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 4000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: commuting, house renting, skin-care, entertaining
Specific constraints for each demand: 
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
house renting: suburban area
entertaining: theater and concerts
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Commuting:
Budget: 300,000 VND
Schema: Purchase a monthly public transportation pass for the 15 km distance. This will provide the most cost-effective way of getting to college as it will allow unlimited travel at a much cheaper rate than paying for individual trips.

House Renting:
Budget: 1,300,000 VND
Schema: Rent a room or a single bedroom apartment in the suburbs. This will help to save money as rent prices in the suburbs are usually cheaper than in the city center. Additionally, this will be a great option for long-term financial stability.

Skin-Care:
Budget: 500,000 VND
Schema: Purchase basic skin-care products such as cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, etc. It is important to invest in quality skin-care products that are within your budget constraints.

Entertaining:
Budget: 1,000,000 VND
Schema: Attend theater and concerts that are within your budget. Look for discounted tickets or special offers at venues. Additionally, attending local events such as festivals or art shows can also be a great and affordable way to have fun.
