I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: investing, commuting, playing sport, food
Specific constraints for each demand: 
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
playing sport: football or badminton
food: calories reduce
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Investing: Allocate 15% of your budget which is 375000 VND for investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds or other forms of investments. This will help you to increase your wealth over time, and help you to achieve financial stability. 

Commuting: Allocate 10% of your budget which is 250000 VND for public transportation. This will provide you with a reliable and economical mode of transport when travelling around Ho Chi Minh City. This will also help you to save money long-term, as you will not need to rely on taxis or other high-cost forms of transport. 

Playing Sport: Allocate 25% of your budget which is 625000 VND for sports activities. This will ensure that you have enough money to cover the costs associated with playing the sports you love, such as football or badminton.

Food: Allocate 50% of your budget which is 1250000 VND for food. This will ensure that you have enough money to cover the necessary costs associated with food. Additionally, this will provide you with the opportunity to reduce your calorie intake, by eating healthier options such as fruits and vegetables, which are often cheaper than processed foods. 

The above spending plan is optimized to ensure that you have enough money to cover your essential expenses, and to ensure that you stay within your budget constraints. Additionally, this spending plan is designed to prioritize your long-term financial stability, by allocating a portion of your budget to investing.
