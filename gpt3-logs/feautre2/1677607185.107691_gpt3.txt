==========

Commuting: 
Since you are living in Da Nang, I recommend investing in a bike for your daily commute to work. This will be the most cost-efficient option and will save you money in the long run. You can also consider taking public transport or even walking if it is feasible. 

Entertaining: 
For entertaining, it is best to keep things within your budget and maximize the fun. You can go to local cafes, bars, and restaurants that offer discounts and specials. You can also check out local markets and festivals for entertainment. 

Skin-care: 
Skin-care products can be expensive so it is important to buy quality products that will last. Consider looking for natural and organic products that are more affordable. You can also make your own products using natural ingredients. 

Food: 
High-protein foods can be expensive but there are some cost-effective options available. Consider buying in bulk and stocking up on foods like beans, nuts, and eggs that are high in protein but low in cost. You can also look for discounts on healthy food items, such as fruits and vegetables. 

Total budget allocated:

Commuting: 0 VND
Entertaining: 2,000,000 VND
Skin-care: 1,500,000 VND
Food: 2,500,000 VND

Overall, this optimized spending plan will help you maximize your budget and meet all of your demands. By investing in a bike for your daily commute, you can save money in the long run. When it comes to entertaining, look for discounts and specials, and for skin-care, opt for natural and organic products. For food, buying in bulk and stocking up on high-protein foods is a cost-effective option.
