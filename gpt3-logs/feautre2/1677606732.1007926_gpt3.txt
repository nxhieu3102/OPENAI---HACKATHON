I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, investing, education, skin-care
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: can not cook
education: programming learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: 
Allocate 1,200,000 VND for food. Eating out is more expensive than cooking your own food, so consider eating at home or finding cheaper places to eat out. Considering the location and market prices, this should cover most of your food expenses. 

Investing: 
Allocate 800,000 VND for investing. Investing is a great way to maximize your income over the long term, and this amount should be enough to open a brokerage account or purchase some stocks or mutual funds. Make sure to do your research before investing and consider setting aside a portion for emergency funds.

Education: 
Allocate 600,000 VND for learning programming. This should cover most of the books, online courses, and other materials you need to learn the subject. You can also look for free online resources to help you learn and save a bit of money.

Skin-care: 
Allocate 200,000 VND for skin-care. This amount should cover basic skin-care products such as lotions, cleansers, and moisturizers. Consider buying products in bulk to save money, or look for deals and coupons. You can also find cheaper alternatives to more expensive products.
