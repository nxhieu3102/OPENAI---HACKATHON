I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: house renting, food, education, investing, shopping
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: near city center
food: calories reduce
education: drawing, cooking
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting- 
  Budget Allocation: 1500000 VND
  Schema: Rent an apartment/room close to city center as it is more affordable and can reduce transportation costs. Consider shared apartments with roommates to reduce costs.

Food- 
  Budget Allocation: 600000 VND
  Schema: Buy ingredients and prepare meals at home, which is the most cost-effective way to save on food expenses. Avoid eating out as much as possible, and opt for healthy and fresh foods. Consider buying in bulk to further reduce costs.

Education- 
  Budget Allocation: 900000 VND
  Schema: Invest in online classes or self-learning materials. There are plenty of free or low-cost classes available online. Also, consider investing in books or materials to help you learn.

Investing- 
  Budget Allocation: 300000 VND
  Schema: Invest in long-term investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. Start small and gradually increase the investment amount. Consider automating your investments to ensure consistency.

Shopping- 
  Budget Allocation: 300000 VND
  Schema: Prioritize essential items, and avoid impulse purchases. Research for discounts and special offers before buying. Consider second-hand items as they are usually cheaper. 
  
By following this plan, you can allocate your budget to meet all your demands in the most cost-effective and optimized way. Additionally, you can keep track of your expenses and modify the plan as needed.
