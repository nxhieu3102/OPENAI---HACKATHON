I am a college student living in Da Nang:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, commuting, shopping, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: vegetarian
commuting: 15 km by public transportation
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: Since you are a vegetarian, you can focus on fruits and vegetables as your primary source of nutrition. Look for local markets and stores that offer discounts and bulk discounts. Consider buying fresh produce to save money. Allocate at least 6000000 VND for food. 

Commuting: Invest in a monthly ticket for public transportation. This will allow you to save money in the long run and provide a consistent and reliable way to get around. Allocate at least 4000000 VND for commuting. 

Shopping: To maximize your budget, focus on buying quality items that will last for a long time. Consider buying items that are on sale or look for second-hand options. Allocate at least 3000000 VND for shopping. 

Investing: Investing is an important part of financial stability. Research various investment options before committing to any. Consider an online platform that provides low-cost investments and automated portfolio management. Allocate at least 2000000 VND for investing. 

Overall, this spending plan should help you stay within your budget and provide you with a schema for each demand that allows you to maximize your budget. Prioritize essential expenses over non-essential expenses and focus on long-term financial stability.
