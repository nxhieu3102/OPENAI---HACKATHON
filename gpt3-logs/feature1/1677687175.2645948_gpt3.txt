==========

A good meal option that fits within your budget of 700000 VND is a Grilled Salmon with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Grilled salmon is a healthy and flavorful option, and pairing it with a white wine brings out the flavors and makes it taste even better. Sauvignon Blanc is a light, crisp white wine that is a garden of herbs and grass with a gentle floral note. The price for the Grilled Salmon and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc is 699000 VND, leaving you with a saving of 1000 VND.
