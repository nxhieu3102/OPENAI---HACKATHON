ANSWER: 

==========

Honda CR-V 2020 - 998000000 VND: This is an excellent choice that would optimize your budget and fulfill the conditions you are looking for. It is a versatile SUV with third-row seating and respectable towing capacity that comes with a host of features, such as a power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, and an 8″ touchscreen display. Additionally, CR-V has a great safety features array such as airbags, lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning, and automatic emergency braking. 

Honda Pilot 2020 - 1008000000 VND: This is another great choice that is slightly over your budget, but offers a host of features that may tempt you to stretch the budget a little. The Pilot comes with the same towing capacity as the CR-V and even more third-row seating. The interior is also luxurious and roomy, with a 8″ touchscreen display, automatic climate control, and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. It also has great safety features such as airbags, lane assistance, and blind spot monitoring. 

Both of these vehicles will be within your budget, optimize your budget, and peak your interests. It comes down to preference, so when deciding between the two, make sure you weigh the pros and cons of each SUV before making a purchase.
