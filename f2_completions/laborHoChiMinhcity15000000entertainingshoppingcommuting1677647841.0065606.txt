Entertaining:

This should be your highest priority. Consider allocating 7000000 VND for this category. Spend 5000000 VND on theater tickets and the remaining 2000000 VND on concerts. This should allow you to attend several shows a month. 

Shopping:

Consider allocating 4000000 VND for shopping. This should cover most of your basic needs. Make sure to look for discounts and sales to maximize your spending.

Commuting:

Since your commute is only 3 km, consider using a bicycle or walking. This will not only save you money, but also help you stay physically active. Allocate the remaining 4000000 VND for any necessary transportation costs.

Overall, this spending plan should allow you to meet all of your demands while staying within your budget. By minimizing costs where possible and prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential ones, you should be able to maximize your budget and ensure long-term financial stability.
