Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, shopping, entertaining, commuting, food
Specific constraints for each demand:

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sports: 
Allocate 20% of the budget which is 600,000 VND for playing sports. 
Schema: For playing sports, opting for gymming and dancing is the best way to maximize the budget. Gymming is an ideal way to exercise and can be done at a fraction of the cost of joining a gym. Look for local gyms that offer discounts or have group classes. Dancing is also a great way to exercise and can be done in the comfort of your own home or at a local dance studio. 

Shopping: 
Allocate 30% of the budget which is 900,000 VND for shopping. 
Schema: Shopping can be done in a variety of ways. Look for discounts and sales at local stores or online. Consider purchasing items in bulk or shopping at discount stores to save money. You can also opt for secondhand or thrift stores to get the most bang for your buck.

Entertaining: 
Allocate 10% of the budget which is 300,000 VND for entertaining. 
Schema: For entertaining, focus on activities that are low cost or free. Consider cooking at home, watching movies online, or playing board games. Going out for drinks can be expensive, so opt for a happy hour or try to find deals on drinks. 

Commuting: 
Allocate 20% of the budget which is 600,000 VND for commuting. 
Schema: Consider taking public transportation or ride-sharing services to save money on commuting costs. You can also look for bike-sharing programs or carpooling to reduce the cost of commuting. 

Food: 
Allocate 20% of the budget which is 600,000 VND for food. 
Schema: Focus on buying healthy and affordable food options, such as fruits and vegetables. Purchase food in bulk or shop at discount stores to reduce costs. Look for meal plans that offer healthy and affordable meals. Consider preparing meals in advance and freezing them for future use. 

By following this plan, you can optimize your budget and maximize your spending power. Keeping track of your spending and setting a budget before making any purchases can help you stay within your financial limits. Additionally, focusing on activities that are low cost or free can help you save money while still having fun.
