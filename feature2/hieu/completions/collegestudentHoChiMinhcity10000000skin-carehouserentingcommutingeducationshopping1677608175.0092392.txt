Skin-care: 3000 VND per month (this amount will cover basic skin-care needs such as sunscreen, moisturizer, and facial cleanser). 
House Renting: 5000000 VND per month (this amount should cover a comfortable 1-bedroom apartment near the city center). 
Commuting: 100000 VND for monthly public transport pass (this should cover the 3 km to work each day).
Education: 2000000 VND per month (this amount should cover the cost of drawing and cooking classes).

In order to maximize the budget and optimize for long-term financial stability, it is important to prioritize essential expenses (housing, commuting, and education) over non-essential expenses (skin-care and shopping).

Finally, plan ahead and try to save some money each month so that you can put it towards saving for the future.
