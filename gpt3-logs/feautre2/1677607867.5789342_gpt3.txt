I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 4000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: entertaining, education, skin-care
Specific constraints for each demand: 
entertaining: drinking, cooking
education: programming learning
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Entertaining: 

Allocate 40% of your budget to entertaining, which comes to 1,600,000 VND. This will enable you to enjoy yourself while still staying within your budget. For drinking, allocate 500,000 VND to buy beer and other drinks from local stores or markets to minimize costs. Likewise, allocate 500,000 VND for cooking ingredients to make meals at home. This will be a cheaper option than eating out and will also allow you to cook dishes that suit your taste.

Education: 

Allocate 30% of your budget to education, which comes to 1,200,000 VND. Invest in learning resources such as books and online courses to get the most out of your money. Try to find free courses or tutorials that you can use to get a better understanding of programming. Additionally, enroll in a local coding bootcamp if your budget allows, as this can provide you with more comprehensive learning opportunities.

Skin-care: 

Allocate the remaining 30% of your budget to skin-care, which comes to 1,200,000 VND. Invest in a good quality moisturizer, toner, and cleanser that can address any skin issues you may have. Additionally, you can use this budget to purchase facial masks and other skin-care products that can help keep your skin healthy. This should provide you with a comprehensive skin-care regimen that will help keep your skin looking and feeling great.
