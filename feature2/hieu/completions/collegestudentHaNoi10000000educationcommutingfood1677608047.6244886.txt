To maximize your budget, you can prioritize essential expenses, minimize costs, and look for discounts or deals. For example, instead of spending money on expensive meals, you could buy food in bulk or cook at home. You could also take advantage of discounts or coupons at supermarkets or other stores. Furthermore, if you plan to take cooking or drawing classes, look for group discounts or cheaper alternatives to maximize your budget.
