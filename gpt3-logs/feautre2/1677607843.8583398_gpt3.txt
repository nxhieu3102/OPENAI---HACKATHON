I am a college student living in Ho Chi Minh city:
Total budget: 4000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, commuting, education, shopping
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: calories reduce
commuting: 3 km to work
education: drawing, cooking
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: 3000 VND per day, total of 210000 VND per month:
This amount should be enough to cover basic meals and snacks. Consider buying in bulk and focusing on basic, nutritious food items such as rice, legumes, and vegetables. Look for discounts and coupons to reduce costs.

Commuting: 1000 VND per day, total of 70000 VND per month:
This amount should be enough to cover the 3km commute. Consider taking public transportation or cycling to save money.

Education: 600 VND per day, total of 42000 VND per month:
This amount should be enough to cover basic materials for drawing and cooking. Research local educational opportunities to learn more about drawing and cooking. Look for discounts and coupons to reduce costs.

Shopping: 800 VND per day, total of 56000 VND per month:
This amount should be enough to cover basic items such as clothes, toiletries, and other items. Research local stores for the best prices and look for discounts and coupons to reduce costs. 

Overall, this optimized spending plan should leave you with 218000 VND leftover each month. Consider using this leftover amount to save for a rainy day or to invest in other areas in order to maximize your long-term financial stability.
