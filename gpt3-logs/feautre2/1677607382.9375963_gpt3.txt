I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 2500000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: house renting, playing sport, investing, entertaining, shopping
Specific constraints for each demand: 
house renting: not far from city center
playing sport: swimming and bicycling
entertaining: traveling, go backpacking
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

House Renting: 1600000 VND
This should be the priority as it is essential for your living needs and will be taking up the majority of your budget. Make sure to find a place that is not too far from the city center to minimize transportation costs. Consider looking for a place with other renters to split the costs. 

Playing Sport: 200000 VND
This is a non-essential expense but can bring lots of health benefits and joy. To maximize your budget, try to find a cheap gym nearby or purchase a second-hand bike. For swimming, find a public pool near you that offers discounted rates for students. 

Investing: 250000 VND
Investing in the stock market can be a great way to increase your wealth over time, however it is important to understand the risks involved. Start by investing small amounts and research the different investment strategies.

Entertaining: 300000 VND
This can be the perfect way to relax and explore the city. A great way to save money is by looking for discounted tickets for travel or local attractions. You can also try to find budget-friendly activities like going to parks rather than expensive restaurants.

Shopping: 100000 VND
Shopping can be a fun way to explore the city, however it can quickly add up. Try to find second-hand stores or thrift shops to save money. Also, make sure to only buy what you need and don't impulse buy. 

Overall, the spending plan should be optimized for long-term financial stability. By prioritizing essential expenses and cutting back on non-essential expenses, you can maximize your budget and ensure that you stay within your financial constraints. Good luck!
