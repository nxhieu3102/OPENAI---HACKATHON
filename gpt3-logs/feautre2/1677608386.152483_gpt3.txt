Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Skin Care: 
This should be one of your top priorities as it is essential for your well-being. Try to find affordable skin care products from local stores and markets, as they are likely to be cheaper than those from international brands. Invest in products that will last longer, as this will save you money in the long-term. Allocate around 2,000,000 VND for this. 

Entertaining: 
Drinking and cooking are two essential activities for entertaining. When it comes to drinking, you can try to buy alcohol in bulk or look for happy hour deals at your local bar. For cooking, it is best to buy ingredients in bulk, which will save you money. Allocate around 1,000,000 VND for this. 

Investing: 
Investing is a great way to build your financial security and increase your wealth over time. You can start by investing in low-risk investments such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You should also look into index funds, which are a good way to diversify your investments. Allocate around 5,000,000 VND for this. 

Food: 
As a vegetarian, you should stick to eating mostly plant-based foods. Buy fresh fruits and vegetables from your local markets and try to buy in bulk to save money. You can also look for deals on grains and legumes, which are a great way to get the nutrients your body needs. Allocate around 4,000,000 VND for this. 

Education: 
IELTS learning is an important investment for your future. Look for online courses that offer discounts or look for tutors in your area who will give you a better rate. You should also consider purchasing study materials for extra practice. Allocate around 4,000,000 VND for this. 

Overall, you should allocate around 15,000,000 VND for your budget. This should provide you with enough money to cover all of your essential expenses while still allowing you to invest and save for the future.
