I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 10000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, shopping, house renting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: can not cook
house renting: not far from city center
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: 
For food, you should allocate a budget of 5000000 VND. This includes the cost of eating out, which is usually cheaper than cooking. Try to stick to affordable restaurants and food stalls where you can get quality meals for a reasonable price. Look for discounts and promotions as well. 

House Renting: 
For house renting, you should allocate a budget of 4000000 VND. It is important to find a place that is close to the city center and has access to public transportation. Look for places that have lower rental rates, but make sure that they are safe and secure. You should also consider other costs such as utilities, deposits, and fees.

Shopping: 
For shopping, you should allocate a budget of 1000000 VND. Shop for items that you need and prioritize quality over quantity. Look for discounts and sales to maximize your budget. Consider buying second-hand items or shopping at thrift stores. Focus on purchasing items that will last a long time and will not need to be replaced frequently. 

You should also consider creating a budgeting plan to help you manage your expenses. This will help you stay within your budget and will ensure that you are able to cover all of your essential costs.
