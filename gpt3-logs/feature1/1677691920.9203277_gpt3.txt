ANSWER: 

==========

For your budget and criteria, I would recommend opting for a one or 2 bedroom apartment in a suburban area of Ho Chi Min City. These places tend to be known for their cozy, personalized atmosphere, and based on the current market, you can find quite an affordable house. 

For example, a 2 bedroom apartment located in suburban District 7 of Ho Chi Minh City can be found at an average market price of $3,000 USD. The apartment is newly renovated with modern amenities and is located close to a bustling shopping district, giving you ample opportunities to explore the city and finding your own cozy personal space. 

Another option is for a 1 bedroom apartment located in District 8 of the city. This area is known for its peaceful vibes and provides entry to major avenues for business and leisure. The average market price for this option is around $2,200 USD. 

Overall, these two options seem to be the best for your criteria and budget. The suburbs of Ho Chi Minh City offer a modern, personalized experience, along with an affordable living, making it an ideal place to buy a house.
