Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Investing: 5000000 VND - This money should be used to invest in a safe and reliable asset, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs, so that you can enjoy the returns over the long term.

Entertaining: 2000000 VND - Shopping can be expensive, so try to look for sales and discounts when possible. If you need more entertainment, consider activities such as going to the movies, attending concerts, or going to the theater.

Food: 4000000 VND - Cut down on your food expenses by buying in bulk, making meals at home, and cooking with healthy ingredients. Make sure to stay within your calorie budget by counting calories and tracking your meals.

Playing Sport: 1000000 VND - Karate is a great way to stay active and learn self-defense, so investing in a karate class is a great way to stay healthy and safe. Consider signing up for a gym membership if you want more variety in your exercise. This will also allow you to access various equipment and classes.
