Education: You should allocate around 300,000 VND for IELTS learning. This should cover the cost of materials, classes, and other related expenses. 

Overall, your total budget should be around 2,500,000 VND and the optimal spending plan should be as follows: 
Food: 1,000,000 VND
Commuting: 600,000 VND
Playing Sport: 400,000 VND

In order to optimize your budget, you should try to find deals and discounts when going out to eat, look for cheaper transportation options, and look for cheaper housing options. Additionally, you should prioritize essential expenses such as rent and food over non-essential expenses such as playing sport and IELTS learning. This will help to ensure that you stay within your budget constraints and still have enough money for essential expenses. Finally, when making your spending decisions, try to think about long-term financial stability and look for ways to save money in the long-term.
