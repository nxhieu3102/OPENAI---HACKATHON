Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Education:
Allocation: 4000000 VND
Schema: Invest in online resources such as coding boot camps or online courses for programming learning. Consider enrolling in a university or college for the long-term as this will help you build up your foundation in programming and can provide you with valuable networking opportunities.

House Renting:
Allocation: 5000000 VND
Schema: Consider renting an apartment or a house near the city center. This will provide you with easy access to key amenities and services and will also help you in saving money on transportation. Additionally, you can look for shared accommodations to reduce the overall cost of rent.

Investing:
Allocation: 3000000 VND
Schema: Invest in low-risk assets such as bonds, mutual funds, and stocks. Alternatively, you can also invest in real estate as this can be lucrative in the long-term. Consider researching the market before investing and make sure you're investing wisely.

Skincare:
Allocation: 3000000 VND
Schema: Invest in natural skin care products such as natural oils, herbal extracts, and essential oils. Try to avoid products with harsh chemicals or harsh synthetic fragrances as these can irritate your skin.
