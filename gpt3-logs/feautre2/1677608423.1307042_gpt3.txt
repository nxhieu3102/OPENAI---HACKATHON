I am a college student living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 15000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: playing sport, entertaining, skin-care, investing
Specific constraints for each demand: 
playing sport: football or badminton
entertaining: party, go to coffee
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Playing Sport: 5000000 VND 
Optimization: Play football or badminton, which is less expensive than other sports. Also, look for discounts or group rates that may help you save money.

Entertaining: 3000000 VND 
Optimization: Look for free activities or go to cheaper places like coffee shops or low-cost bars. If you are going to have a party, try to keep it small and to only invite close friends and family.

Skin-Care: 4000000 VND
Optimization: Try using natural products or those that are on sale. Research online and compare prices to get the best deal. Also, look for masks and other treatments that can be done at home to save money.

Investing: 3000000 VND
Optimization: Start by investing in low-risk investments, such as mutual funds, ETFs, or index funds. These investments have the potential to generate returns over time, but are low-risk and can be withdrawn at any time. You can also consider investing in stocks, but research the market and make sure you understand the risks before investing.
