I am a bank staff living in Ha Noi:
Total budget: 3000000 VND 
Demands that I want to meet: food, shopping, playing sport, education, commuting
Specific constraints for each demand: 
food: vegetarian
playing sport: gyming, dancing
education: drawing, cooking
commuting: 10 km to school, by motorbike
Based on this information, generate an optimized spending plan that tells me how much I should allocate for each demand and a schema for each demand that maximizes my budget. Please include any relevant explanations or insights that can help me make informed spending decisions.

Consider the following factors when generating the spending plan:

Using living location for a hint of market price
Minimizing costs where possible
Prioritizing essential expenses over non-essential expenses
Ensuring that the user stays within their budget constraints
Optimizing for long-term financial stability

Plan my spending optimally:

==========

Food: 1800 VND per day for vegetarian meals. This amount should cover breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
Shopping: 800 VND per month for basic necessities. 
Playing Sport: 1500 VND per month for gym membership. 
Education: 2000 VND per month for drawing and cooking classes. 
Commuting: 500 VND per month for motorbike maintenance and fuel.

Total: 5,100 VND per month 

This spending plan will help you stay within your budget while still meeting all your needs. It also allows you to save money for future expenses and prepare for any unexpected costs. Additionally, by prioritizing essential expenses, you can be sure that you are always making informed spending decisions.
