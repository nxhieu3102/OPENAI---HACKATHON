ANSWER: 

==========

Mazda CX-8 Grand Touring SUV - This option provides the perfect combination of third-row seating, high towing capacity, and affordability. It has a base price of 855,000,000 VND and comes with features such as seven comfortable seats, a rearview camera, cruise control, and keyless entry. Additionally, its strong 2.5-liter turbocharged engine can tow up to 750 kg for those who need to haul items. With the remaining 145,000,000 VND of your budget, you can upgrade features such as a moonroof package, BOSE sound system, and advanced driving assistance technologies.
