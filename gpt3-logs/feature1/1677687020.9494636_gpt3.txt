ANSWER: 

==========

-Grilled Salmon with bone (600000 VND): This type of grilled salmon is a good choice for budget optimization as it is less expensive than filleted salmon. Its juicy and flavourful, perfect to pair with some white wine.

-White Wine (400000 VND): For the white wine, you should choose a dry white wine like Sauvignon Blanc which has a crisp and clean taste. This wine is perfect with the grilled salmon, as it manages to cut through the fat and bring out the flavor of the fish.
