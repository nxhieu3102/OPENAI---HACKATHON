Commuting: 
Allocate 20% of the budget for commuting. This will allow you to take public transportation for 15 km for approximately 12000 VND a day. This will result in a total expenditure of 360000 VND for 5 months.

Investing: 
Allocate 65% of the budget for investments. It is important to invest in low-risk investments such as bonds, mutual funds, and stocks. This will help to ensure a secure future and help you reach your financial goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investments. 

Overall, by following this plan, you can ensure that you are able to meet your demands while still staying within your budget. Additionally, it is important to be aware of your spending habits and adjust your budget as needed to ensure financial stability in the long run.
